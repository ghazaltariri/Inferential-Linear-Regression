# Inferential-Linear-Regression

Linear Regression is highly useful when it comes to a tool for inferential analysis.

These are the assumptions of the linear regression model:
* Observations are independent.
* Errors have constant conditional variance.
* Errors are normally distributed.

We need to understand p-values associated with beta coefficients and then interpret them to gain insight into the relationship between variables.
